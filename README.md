## Workshops

There are a ton of nodeschool interactive workshops (https://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list), but I combed through them and looked closely at some of the electives & thought that these ones look especially helpful & relevant for Javascript development:

  * "Functional Javascript"
  * "ExpressWorks"
  * "Async You"
  * "LololoDash"
  * "regex-adventure"
